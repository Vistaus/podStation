# v1.33.0 - Release Notes

## New features

### Experimental: Lightning protocol based Value 4 Value with LNPay

This release delivers experimental support for the _value for value_ monetization model with streaming Bitcoints/Satoshis.

In this monetization model, listeners can _stream_ money to podcasters as they listen to episodes, using _KeySend_ payments over the _Lightning Network_. This model was proposed by Adam Curry and Dave Jones from https://podcastindex.org.

In [v1.33.0](./v1.33.0.md) we delivered a similar feature, but integrating with an LND node.

In this version we implement support for LNPay (<https://lnpay.co>), a service for custodial Lightning wallets.  
This service is used to hold your lightning funds and handle the payments to podcasters (or any node configured in the podcast's value block).

#### Pre-requisites

In order to use this feature, you will need to sign-up to LNPay (https://lnpay.co/home/signup), create a wallet and configure your Public API Key and Wallet Access Key in the options in podStation.
You will also need to fund your wallet.

After signing up and logging in you will find your Public API Key at <https://lnpay.co/developers/dashboard>, and after creating a wallet you will find its access key in the wallet's detail.

#### How to enable it?

Go to podStation's options page, in the Lightning payments section, select the integration type _lnpay.co_.  
Set the API Key and Wallet Access Key.  
Save your changes and use the button _Test LNPay connection_ to check if the integration is working.

#### How to know if it is really working?

Currently there is no UI where the user can inspect what is happening, the only way to get any feedback (aside from inspecting the transfers and logs of your LND node), is to inspect the logs of podStation's background page.

To do so, go to <chrome://extensions/> and click on the details of podStation, look for _Inspect views_ and click on the `background.html` view, then check the console. There, when playing value enabled podcasts, you should see either success or error messages for the payment.

#### Limitations

Just as explained in the release note

#### Technical details

#### Disclaimer

This solution is very experimental, I myself only tested in a local bitcoin _regtest_ environment (I will eventually setup the real deal, but I wanted to put it out there as soon as possible).

Consider enabling the test mode first and inspecting the logs for the payments that _would have been sent_, and check if the values are ok, before you use it for real. If possible, connect it with a node that only has funds you can spare.
